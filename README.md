# Stripe API

A simple application using Stripe API to purchase books.

### TECHNOLOGIES/NPM MODULES
1. stripe
2. express-handlebars
3. Express.js
4. Node.js

### WHAT I LEARNED
1. Stripe definitely has a very easy API to get around, and the dashboard is very intuitive.

### FUTURE
1. NPM's stripe module is has better documentation than PayPal's, so if I were to develop any type of Ecommerce app, I would use Stripe.
